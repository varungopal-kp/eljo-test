Dependencies: The application relies on the following hidden environment variables, which are not included in the submission for security reasons:
        #### 1. `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
        - Used for Google authentication or API integration.
        - This variable needs to be added to the `.env` file.

        #### 2. SMTP Configuration
        - Includes details such as the SMTP host, port, username, and password.
        - These are located in the configuration folder (`config`) and are necessary for email functionality.

A sample `.env` file is provided to outline the required variables for setup. Please populate the `.env` file and config files with the appropriate values before running the application.
